CPS is a revolutionary tool that enhances cognitive performance through dynamic, AI-driven applications. It provides users with interactive tools and real-time feedback to help measure, understand, and improve cognitive functions like memory, attention, and problem-solving.

## 🚀 Live Demo

This is the perfect place to showcase the magic of your application. The new layout selection animation can be framed as the system preparing a cognitive task.

💥 **Pro Tip:** Record a high-quality GIF of the entire process: logging in, selecting a cognitive task, the **Layout Selector Animation** kicking in as the task loads, and the final interactive task appearing.

## 💡 Core Concept

Understanding and improving one's cognitive health is crucial in today's demanding world. Traditional methods for cognitive assessment can be static and unengaging. CPS is built on a powerful idea: **what if you could improve your mind by playing?**

By transforming cognitive training into an interactive and enjoyable experience, CPS helps users stay engaged, motivated, and consistent in their journey toward better mental performance.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The user experience is designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible:

1.  **Authenticate:** Log in to your personal dashboard to access your profile and performance history.
2.  **Select a Task:** Choose from a variety of cognitive games and assessments targeting different skills.
3.  **Engage:** The system prepares the task, showing the dynamic loading animation, and presents the interactive challenge.
4.  **Analyze Performance:** After completing the task, review your results and track your progress on your dashboard.
